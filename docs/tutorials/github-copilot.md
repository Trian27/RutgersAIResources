## Overview
This is a nontechnical tutorial of how to use Github Copilot

## Installation
If you don't have an github account, go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create an account. Then go to [education.github.com](https://education.github.com) and follow the signup steps. You will need a school verified email. Then go through the registration process and you are signed up for github copilot! This may take a bit to verify. For students this is absolutely free to use. You can use copilot within multiple forums, including Github, multiple IDE's, and Windows Terminal. It is however mostly used within an IDE. Check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-code-suggestions-in-your-ide-with-github-copilot) for a list of IDE's Copilot works with and even how to start using them. But in general you can add it as an extension or plugin and then signin. You will have to make sure you have an up-to-date version of your IDE that supports the extension/plugin as well.
